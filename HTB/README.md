# Hack The Box – Write-Up Collection

Welcome to my personal collection of Hack The Box walkthroughs. Each write-up reflects not just what I hacked, but *how* I thought — documenting my progress as a self-taught cybersecurity student and future ethical hacker.

All boxes were completed using Kali Linux in a VirtualBox lab setup, connected through OpenVPN.
