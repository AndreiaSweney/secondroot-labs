# secondroot-labs

Welcome to `secondroot-labs`, my public cybersecurity learning archive.

This repo documents my hands-on journey into ethical hacking and blue team operations, starting from the ground up.  It includes structured walkthroughs, tool breakdowns, and personal notes from platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and my own home lab.

I created this space not just to practice, but to prove — with consistency, clarity, and curiosity.



## About Me

I'm Andreia Sweeney, a remote QA professional making the pivot into cybersecurity with a focus on ethical hacking.

No CS degree. Just pure strategy, sweat, and study. I'm here to *learn out loud*, break things safely, and build something I can be proud of.
