# Security+ Study Notes

Welcome to my personal Security+ study notes. This folder is part of my active preparation for the **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** certification, and is meant to serve as a living reference for key concepts, terms, and frameworks across all exam domains.

##  What You’ll Find Here

Each markdown file in this folder includes:
- **Concise summaries** of key cybersecurity principles
- **Organized tables and comparisons** to support retention
- **Hands-on references** and mental models used in real-world security work

> These notes are based on Dion Training, Hack The Box Academy, and other verified Security+ resources.

## Why I’m Sharing This

- **Documentation = discipline.** Sharing my notes publicly helps me stay consistent and accountable.
- **Reinforcement through teaching.** Writing helps me master the material, not just memorize it.
- **Building in the open.** I’m transitioning into cybersecurity and want to show the process, not just the results.

## Tools Used

- Markdown for formatting
- GitHub for version control and transparency
- VS Code, Obsidian, and CLI tools as part of my learning environment

## Topics Covered So Far

- CIA Triad and AAA
- Zero Trust Architecture
- Encryption models
- Security control types and categories
- PKI, Steganography, TPM, and more

This folder will continue to grow and evolve as I progress through each Security+ domain.
